##Combination Connectivity Mapping

`ccmap` finds drugs and drug combinations that are predicted to reverse or
mimic gene expression signatures. These drugs might reverse diseases or mimic 
healthy lifestyles. See [vignette](http://bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/vignettes/ccmap/inst/doc/ccmap-vignette.html) for usage.

`ccmap` is available through [Bioconductor](http://bioconductor.org/packages/ccmap/).
